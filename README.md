### What is this?
* RT-Everywhere is an attempt to make a *basic* toy CPU raytracer and port it to as many platforms as possible

### Platforms
| Platform        | Support State                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Windows (Win32) | Complete (Native and SDL2)    |
| macOS           | Complete (Native and SDL2)    |
| Unix-like (X11) | Complete (SDL2)               |

**All nintendo ports have been removed from this repo due to devkitPro being accused of stealing proprietary code from Nintendo SDKs!**
